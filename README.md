## Installation And Test

You will need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/) setup on your machine. That will output the built distributables to `./dist/*` .


**Step 1.** Use NPM (Locate your current directory of project, and enter the following command.) or download the latest version from [Github](https://github.com/xizon/uix-webpack-typescript-jest-react-scaffold). For nodejs you have to install some dependencies.

```sh
$ sudo npm install uix-webpack-typescript-jest-react-scaffold
```

Or clone the repo to get all source files including build scripts: 

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/xizon/uix-webpack-typescript-jest-react-scaffold.git
```


**Step 2.** First, using an absolute path into your `"uix-webpack-typescript-jest-react-scaffold/"` folder directory.

```sh
$ cd /{your_directory}/uix-webpack-typescript-jest-react-scaffold
```


**Step 3.** Before doing all dev stuff make sure you have `Node 10+` installed. After that, run the following code in the main directory to install the node module dependencies.

```sh
$ sudo npm install
```


**Step 4.** Commonly used commands:

Debug application. It can be checked separately as TypeScript without compiling and packaging behavior.

```sh
$ npm run check
```


**Step 5.** When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

**Step 6.** When you have done, this will spin up a server that can be accessed at

```sh
http://localhost:8080
```
